                <p>Inclusivity plays a crucial role in shaping the future of innovation, ensuring that advancements in science and technology are accessible and beneficial to all. As technological advancements progress, the rising costs of non-essential goods continue to grow, increasing the risk of marginalized groups being left behind. Therefore, designing solutions that are accessible to everyone is crucial. In the context of our iGEM project, we recognize the growing need for inclusive solutions, especially within industries like cosmetics, where affordability, accessibility, and usability often fall short for many. Our project, centered on yeast lysate-based cosmetics, aims to address this by creating products that are not only effective but also accessible to diverse populations. Our approach is rooted in the understanding that inclusivity must address multiple dimensions: socioeconomic, geographic, gender-based, and linguistic.  By integrating these considerations, we aim to reduce disparities in access to technology and resources, ensuring that our innovations can reach underserved communities and underrepresented groups.  This holistic focus on inclusivity is not just about broadening access. It is about empowering people by removing barriers and creating opportunities for engagement, participation, and benefit.  Through this framework, our project aspires to make a tangible impact, fostering equitable growth and demonstrating that inclusivity in science is both an ethical obligation and a driver of more comprehensive, sustainable progress.

                <p>Our human practice involves a number of regions across the country, not only focusing on the popularity of first-tier cities, but also travelling to impoverished areas such as Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province and other places, to carry out teaching social practice for ethnic minorities with a series of biosynthesis-related activities. According to the situation of the students, we designed different activities, such as biosynthesis lectures, experimental classes which consists of several fun biological experiments, skin care questionnaires and so on. As those ethnic minorities are living in high-altitude localities with strong ultraviolet light, it is important to let teenagers understand the necessity of skin care. Through these human practice activities. We hope to make the knowledge of skin care and biosynthesis known to as many people as possible whatever they are in the cities or the rural areas.

                <div class="s2">
                    <p>Color contrast is an important thing to consider when designing an inclusive website. People with visual impairments find it difficult to distinguish web content when color contrast is minimal. When the color contrast is harsh, it can also cause obstacles to browse, cause visual fatigue, and even damage the eyes. Thus, when we designed the website, we first determined the color card, and chose black(0f1819), pink(d63b77) and off-white(f0f0f0) with moderate contrast as the main colors.

                    <p>People with red-green blind account for about 8% of the global male population and about 0.5% of the female population. When designing inclusive websites, avoiding the use of red and green can improve the experience of people with red-green blindness.

                </div>
                <p>Our team's skincare product is designed with a strong emphasis on gender equality and inclusivity. Firstly, the core ingredients we selected—ceramides and bisabolol—are highly versatile and suitable for the skincare needs of all genders. Whether male, female, or non-binary, these ingredients help repair the skin barrier, soothe sensitivity, and improve overall skin health, addressing common concerns faced by all skin types. By avoiding formulations tailored to a specific gender, our product achieves true neutrality in terms of skincare effectiveness.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, throughout the product development process, we have been highly attentive to the diverse and personalized needs of consumers. In today's society, more men are becoming conscious of skincare, while women continue to seek effective and safe products. We recognize that, regardless of gender, everyone shares a similar desire for healthy skin. Therefore, we are committed to breaking down gender boundaries. Our approach is not only to ensure inclusivity through the ingredients but also to challenge traditional gender stereotypes in our brand messaging and market positioning, highlighting the right and opportunity for everyone to care for their skin.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, gender inclusivity is reflected in our product's packaging and marketing strategies. We adopted a minimalist, modern design that avoids colors and symbols traditionally associated with one gender, thus conveying the message that "skincare has no gender." Our goal is to make every consumer, regardless of their gender identity, feel respected and acknowledged. We want them to know that the product is designed to meet their needs without being labeled as gender-specific.
                </p>
                <p>Through this inclusive design, we aim not only to provide an effective skincare experience but also to communicate our commitment to gender equality. We believe that gender inclusivity is not just a trend in the skincare industry, but a social responsibility for all businesses. Our product is not just for men or women—it is for anyone who cares about the health of their skin. This inclusive approach meets the needs of a diverse market while also expressing our stance on the issue of gender equality.
