                <p>In the iGEM, collaboration and communication play a crucial role in advancing projects and sparking innovative ideas. Our team recognizes that in the complex field of synthetic biology, cross-team and interdisciplinary cooperation can provide us with broader perspectives and deeper insights into our research. To further improve the feasibility and completeness of our project, we actively participated in events like the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) and maintained close communication with other university teams. Through sharing project results and experiences, we not only gained valuable feedback but also established long-term collaborations, laying a solid foundation for future research.

                <p><strong> Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)</strong>, is a national exchange meeting initiated by the Chinese iGEM teams themselves, aiming to provide a platform for the participating iGEM teams and Chinese synthetic biology young enthusiasts to share resources and promote mutual learning.

                <p>We attended the 2024 iGEMer China Regional Exchange Conference hosted by Xi 'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University from July 12-14, 2024. At CCiC, we presented our projects and communicated with other teams and experts. Through the communication, <strong>we gained valuable feedback and inspiration</strong>. From the feedback of Professor Xu, we realized that our product needs to be further considered for industrial applications since it has many steps, and it may cost a lot. Thus, we made a cost analysis and presented it in the entrepreneurship part.<a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/izju-china/entrepreneurship#4">(click here for more information)</a>

                <p>We engaged in numerous discussions with the JLU-CP team, who are also involved in the Fashion & Cosmetic Village, during various conferences, including the CCiC. During these interactions, we exchanged our project inspirations and shared insights on subjects like oscillators, their associated subsystems, and mother systems, about the E. coli design. Following our meetings, we established ongoing communication, regularly exchanging thoughts on team management and competition strategies.

                <p>We connected with the ZJUT team early on in our project because we had a common goal of advancing "green development" through our knowledge of the biomanufacturing industry. Later, we had further face-to-face communication during the CCiC. Our discussions centered around the biomanufacturing mechanisms and the design concepts of the human practice parts. The ZJUT team’s self-inducing manufacturing system, based on riboswitches and the lactose operon, was particularly inspiring to us. After the conferences, we continued exchanging ideas on team affairs and competition strategies. This ongoing collaboration fostered innovation, allowing both teams to explore new breakthroughs.

                <p>On July 27, 2024, our team participated in the <strong>Towards Synthetic Biology conference</strong>, which <strong>brought together iGEM teams from across Zhejiang Province</strong>. The event served as a platform for teams to present their projects, exchange ideas, and receive expert feedback. Participating teams included OTIA-Hangzhou, ZJUT-China, Bioplus-Shanghai, HiZJU-China, and others. The conference allowed for valuable networking and knowledge-sharing among peers.

                <p>During the event, our team had the opportunity to <strong>present our ongoing research</strong> and <strong>engage in detailed discussions</strong> with both peers and judges. We benefited greatly from the exchange of ideas with other teams, gaining insight into different approaches and methodologies. The feedback from the judges, however, provided the most critical learning opportunities. They highlighted primary issues: the judges questioned the validity of the statistic that 40% of individuals are sensitive-skinned, prompting us to reconsider the foundational data supporting our project. This detailed feedback not only challenged our current assumptions but also opened avenues for improvement and further research.

The constructive criticism we received prompted us to reevaluate key aspects of our project, particularly the cost-benefit analysis of our proposed methods. We have since adjusted our approach, focusing on simplifying our system and reevaluating the market relevance of our product. Additionally, the conference provided a valuable networking opportunity, allowing us to connect with other teams and discuss potential future collaborations, further broadening the scope of our project.

                <p>Our collaborative efforts have significantly refined our project approach, enhancing both its practicality and scientific rigor. On August 18, 2024, we further expanded our outreach by joining forces with teams like Squirrel-Shanghai, BNDS-China, BUCT-China, NEFU-China, Shanghai-BioX, iZJU-China, Hangzhou-MedX, BIT-China, Hangzhou-SDG, HW-ShanghaiUnited, and Jiangnan-China to host an <strong>online public lecture on synthetic biology</strong>. This event covered three main themes: treatment and diagnosis, skincare, and nutrition, providing valuable information tailored to diverse public interests. Our participation in this initiative allowed us to engage with the community, promote a broader understanding of synthetic biology, and emphasize the real-world applications of our research in healthcare, skincare, nutrition, and environmental solutions. <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/izju-china/education">(click here for more information)</a>

                </div>
                <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a series of global development objectives proposed by the United Nations in 2015, aimed at addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change through global cooperation between 2015 and 2030, to achieve sustainable development worldwide. These goals consist of 17 specific targets, such as eradicating poverty, achieving educational equality, and promoting sustainable cities and communities, which are interrelated and together form a comprehensive framework for global development. In order to popularize and educate the public about the importance and urgency of the SDGs, especially <strong>the Chinese public</strong>, we have collaborated with several teams to create an SDG promotional brochure for the China region. Our team was specifically responsible for writing about the contributions of <strong>businesses to sustainable development</strong>. When crafting this section, we focused on several innovative aspects. Firstly, we emphasized <strong>the combination of data and indicators</strong>: not only did we list the goals and indicators, but we also conducted an in-depth analysis of how to measure progress through quantifiable data, which helps policymakers and businesses better track and evaluate their sustainable development strategies. Secondly, we highlighted <strong>public engagement</strong>: we particularly stressed the importance of raising public awareness and participation, promoting the widespread adoption of sustainable lifestyles through education and community activities, which helps to build a societal consensus and support for the SDGs. By reading the SDG brochure, people can more intuitively understand the concept of sustainable development and recognize the close relationship between individual actions and global goals.
